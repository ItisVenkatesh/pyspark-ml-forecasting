This project demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using PySparkâ€™s MLlib. It includes end-to-end steps to load, visualize, and prepare data for supervised learning by generating lag features. Regression models are used to forecast future values. The project also covers evaluation and visualization of model predictions.
