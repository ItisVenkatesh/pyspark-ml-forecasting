# pyspark-ml-forecasting
This project demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using PySpark‚Äôs MLlib. It includes end-to-end steps to load, visualize, and prepare data for supervised learning by generating lag features. Regression models are used to forecast future values. The project also covers evaluation and visualization of model predictions.

## üìå Features:

    -   Data load from Kaggle site.
    -   Data transformation using PySpark.
    -   Linear Regression Algorithm using PySpark ML Library.
    -   Plot using Seaborn and Matplotlib
    -   Steps to install dependencies and configure the setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

    -   **ETL Tools** : PySpark.
    -   **Language** : Python.
    
## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

    -   Python (Recommended: Python 3.13.1).
